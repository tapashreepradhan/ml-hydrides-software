## How does Entropy influence creep resistance?

A: The flow stress of a material for dislocation motion is given by the Arrhenius equation: σ = σ0 + exp(-Q/RT), where the activation energy Q
is a function of entropy S. (We need to be careful in calculating the relatiosnhip between Q and S from the point of Legendre relationships,
mathematical derivations might be required to decide which state variables can change and which should be constant)
- Once the relationship between flow stress and entropy is determined, we may compare the flow stress as a function of entropy for a high entropy
alloy and a low entropy material to verify if high entropy alloys indeed show higher creep resistance on basis of our models.
- If n number of runs show success (n=10 for example and extending the proof via mathematical induction), quantified results for unseen
HEA-hydrides could be proposed.

Can we show a relationship of entropy with grain boundary strength?

## Pearson Correlation Coefficient
measures linear relationship between two datasets. varies from -1 to +1 with 0 implying no correlation

## Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression:
adds absolute value of magnitude of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function, lasso shrinks the less
important feature's coefficient to zero, removing some features thereby. works for feature selection.
