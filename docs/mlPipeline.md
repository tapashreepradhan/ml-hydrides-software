Matminer for compositions in the dataset
MastML - Featurization (did not use)

Task 0: Data Cleaning + How to code Graph Neural Network.
GNN resource: https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/notebooks/course_UvA-DL/06-graph-neural-networks.html

Task 1: Featurization- One hot encode (Composition)- Dimensionality reduction, Pymatgen- Physics based features for composition (atomic radii, atomic mass, melting point)

Task 2: Preliminary sklearn model runs- accuracy reports and learning rates

Task 3: Hyperparameter optmization and regularization + managing overfitting (Sklearn Models)- Google, chatgpt

Task 4: Graph based ML model (GCN, GCNN, etc)- Nodes features (Principal components of elements) , Edge features- (Properties) , Global features (Material class), visualization- networkx (graph nature)

Task 5: Plotting and results ( 3 models plus 1 empirical relation between entropy and creep)
