How does Entropy influence creep resistance?
A: The flow stress of a material for dislocation motion is given by the Arrhenius equation: σ = σ0 + exp(-Q/RT), where the activation energy Q
is a function of entropy S. (We need to be careful in calculating the relatiosnhip between Q and S from the point of Legendre relationships,
mathematical derivations might be required to decide which state variables can change and which should be constant)
- Once the relationship between flow stress and entropy is determined, we may compare the flow stress as a function of entropy for a high entropy
alloy and a low entropy material to verify if high entropy alloys indeed show higher creep resistance on basis of our models.
- If n number of runs show success (n=10 for example and extending the proof via mathematical induction), quantified results for unseen
HEA-hydrides could be proposed.

Can we show a relationship of entropy with grain boundary strength?
