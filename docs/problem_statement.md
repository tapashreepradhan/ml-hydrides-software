### Goal: Develop software interface that assists in property prediction of hydrides and publish it

## Problems to tackle:

1. Hydrogen Storage Capacity Prediction:

    - Target variable: Hydrogen_Weight_Percent
    - Features based on understanding/experience= Composition_Formula, Heat_of_Formation_kJperMolH2, Temperature_oC, Pressure_Atmospheres_Absolute. 
    - Need to compute Pearson correlation coefficient, L1 regularization (Lasso), or Recursive Feature Addition (RFA)) 
    - Hybridization as the user will only provide Temp, pressure and composition- and our model should internally use surrogate models to predict the other features which go into the main ML model

2. Phase Stability Prediction:
    - Stable/Unstable binary prediction classification for a pernuted chemistry

3. High Entropy Alloy Properties = function(entropy) -> database feature: Entropy of Formation: we'll only predict the target properties.
- creep resistance
    - tensile strength

## Graph Neural Networks: hydride systems as nodes

## Only ML: all the models in sci-kit learn
comparision between the two.

## Features:
1. Composition based featurization
2. Structure based featurization

## PCA vs Non-PCA Analysis
